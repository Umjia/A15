The Question given was to find whether a matrix is a rising matrix or not.
For this problem I took a matrix of mxn and using a for loop I checked the columns if all of them had a descending order then the matrix was a rising one but even if one of them was not in a descending order then it was not a rising matrix.
The most important variable here was count whaich was a boolean variable and its value decided whether the matrix is rising or not.
